# Clean Architecture - Learning Notes

This repository contains my learning notes when I'm reading Clean Architecture book by Robert C. Martin. While the notes are primarily aimed to help myself understanding the materials in the book, I do hope whoever reads these notes will benefit something from them. Kindly give me feedback if you happen to read this and find something wrong with my understanding of the materials.
